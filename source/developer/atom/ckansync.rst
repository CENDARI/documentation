AtoM-CKAN Synchronisation
=========================

The files edited in AtoM are synchronised to the CENDARI CKAN repository once per day.
This is achieved by a script collection specifically created during the CENDARI project.
The code is availabe on `GitHub <https://github.com/CENDARI/atom2ckan>`_.

The scripts rely on modifications to the AtoM Database that need to be guessed form the scripts Readme or the code itself.

.. todo:: Actually provide the specifications of the DB changes.
