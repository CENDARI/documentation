AtoM - Access to Memory
======

**AtoM** stands for Access to Memory. It is a web-based, open source application for standards-based archival description and access in a multilingual, multi-repository environment.


**Starting your search**

Start with a simple search like :menuselection:`manuscript`. Enter your search terms in the search field. You can browse the results by the proposed list
(:menuselection:`Archival descriptions`, :menuselection:`Archival institutions`, :menuselection:`Subjects` and :menuselection:`Places`) or you narrow your search by facets. You will get a list of records and
record creators that match your search criteria. These search results also show which archival institutions hold the proper records. 

The lists provided show all records from all archives, according to CENDARIs priority to provide transnational access and multilingual content.
Narrow down your search results by using the facets provided on the left side. Choose from the proposed level of description (collections,
fonds, etc.); archival institutions with relevant holdings; creators (if it differs from archival institutions); place (choose by country); and by
subject (however, not all archival descriptions contain subject access points). Choose keywords carefully, and spell them correctly. When
you're deciding what keywords to put in the search field, try to choose words that are likely to appear on the record you're looking for.

You can narrow down search results for complex searches by using the **Advanced Search** page. You will reach it by
clicking on the search field or you go directly to the `Advanced Search page <https://archives.cendari.dariah.eu/index.php/search/advanced>`_.
Enter your search terms in the field :menuselection:`Search`. Narrow it down by using the dropdown menu to the right of the :menuselection:`Any field` button, choosing the
fields that should be searched (:menuselection:`title`, :menuselection:`reference code`, etc.). You can always add new criteria and combine them with logical connectives
(:menuselection:`or`, :menuselection:`and`, :menuselection:`not`).
You can filter your search results to find exactly what you are searching. Search filters on the left side of the Advanced search page will help
you to narrow down your search. Use such search filters as :menuselection:`repository`, :menuselection:`level of description` and etc.
If you are searching for sources on a certain topic, please bear in mind that the archival holdings described in AtoM cannot be seen as being
exhaustive, even if there are several dozen entries available for an archive. Archival descriptions have been produced according to the needs
of the topical Archival Research Guides and not with the aim to provide a comprehensive overview of all sources available in an archive.
Please, generally search independently from the language within the collections. If you are looking for results in certain language, type
keywords in this language (and in the appropriate script, f.ex. cyrillic) into the search box.
